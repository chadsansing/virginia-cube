A repo for sharing the contents of the Virginia Cube, a Magic the Gathering draft cube.

## Development

The Virginia Cube started as a mix of cards and proxies based on the Magic the Gathering Online (MTGO) Vintage Cube.

We have since updated it with local players' favorite cards from throughout Magic history, as well as with several multi-color cards to promote a red splash in other decks.

Development began in 2016. We typically rotate 10 cards every other month.

## Themes

Well-suppiorted themes that are draftable from the cube include:

- 5C Ramp
- Artifacts
- Big Green
- BUG Control
- Mill
- Bx Reanimator
- Super Friends
- UW Control
- Ux Tempo
- Wx Prison
