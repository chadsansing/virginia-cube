A repo for sharing the contents of the Virginia Cube, a Magic the Gathering draft cube.

The make-up of the Virginia Cube is licensed under a GNU 2.0 license.

Other original repo copy and content are licensed CC-BY.

We claim no ownership whatsoever over the card designs in the cube.

## Development

The Virginia Cube started as a mix of cards and proxies based on the Magic the Gathering Online (MTGO) Vintage Cube.

We have since updated it with local players' favorite cards from throughout Magic history, as well as with several multi-color cards to promote a red splash in other decks.

Development began in 2016. We typically cycle cards in and out when a new set comes out, which gives us a cosistent, recurring opportunity to evaluate what's working and not working in the cube and to add cards - new and old - that can help improve it and make it more fun to draft.

## Themes
Well-supported themes that are draftable from the cube include:

- 5C Ramp
- Artifacts
- Big Green
- BUG Control
- Mill
- Bx Reanimator
- Super Friends
- UW Control
- Ux Tempo
- Wx Prison

We're using red to splash a lot of wheel effects and make the color more draftable.
